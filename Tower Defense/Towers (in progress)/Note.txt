Hello!

I have implemented the Tower class of the project.

This package creates 3 towers that can be upgraded. I have also coded the logic for changing tower strategy. 
The problem was that I wasn't able to inout the critter attributes in the method correctly, which gave an error and is hence commented out.

I will now create an arraylist of critters with attributes and pass the list through each function in my Tower class.
This would correct the problem.
